# Apache Spark Connect Client for Rust

This project houses the **experimental** client for [Spark
Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html) for
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


## Current State of the Project

Currently, the Spark Connect client for Rust is **highly experimental** and **should
not be used in any production setting**. This is currently a "proof of concept" to identify the methods
of interacting with Spark cluster from rust.

## Quick Start

The `spark-connect-rs` aims to provide an entrypoint to [Spark Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html), and provide *similar* DataFrame API interactions.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

```rust
use spark_connect_rs;

use spark_connect_rs::{SparkSession, SparkSessionBuilder};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let spark = SparkSessionBuilder::remote("sc://127.0.0.1:15002/".to_string())
            .build()
            .await?;

    let mut df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM json.`/opt/spark/examples/src/main/resources/employees.json`");

    df.filter("salary > 3000").show(Some(5), None, None).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/sjrusso8/spark-connect-rs.git
git submodule update --init --recursive

docker compose up --build -d

cargo build && cargo test
```

## Features

The following section outlines some of the larger functionality that
is not yet working with this Spark Connect implementation.

- ![open] TLS authentication & Databricks compatability
- ![open] streaming implementation
- ![open] groupBy, aggregation, and window functions
- ![open] better error handling
- ![open] converting RecordBatch output into a polars DataFrame

### DataFrameWriter

Spark Connect *should* respect the format as long as your cluster supports the specified type and has the
required jars
